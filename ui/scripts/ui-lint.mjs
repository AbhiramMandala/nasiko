/**
 * Architectural lint for the UI layer (`ui/`).
 *
 * There is no bundler, no type checker and no ESLint here, so every rule in
 * AGENTS.md and ARCHITECTURE.md is currently a convention that a person has to
 * remember. This makes the load-bearing ones mechanical.
 *
 * ─── Why it ratchets instead of failing outright ───────────────────────────
 * A lint that reports 1,200 pre-existing violations on day one gets switched off
 * by the end of the week, and then it protects nothing. So each rule declares how
 * it is enforced:
 *
 *   enforce: 'zero'    — must never occur. Any finding fails.
 *   enforce: 'ratchet' — a recorded baseline count that may go DOWN but never up.
 *
 * The baseline is checked in (`ui-lint-baseline.json`) and is a deliberately
 * uncomfortable document: it is the measured debt, per rule, and every number in
 * it is a thing someone chose not to fix yet. Lower one and re-run with
 * `--update-baseline`.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node ui/scripts/ui-lint.mjs
 *   node ui/scripts/ui-lint.mjs --update-baseline
 *   node ui/scripts/ui-lint.mjs --rule=layer-direction   # one rule, verbose

 * files, and whether a file counted as design-system depended on someone
 * remembering to add its name to that Set. It had already drifted — nine
 * `app-*` files were absent from it, so they silently linted as COMPONENT.
 *
 * Now the path carries the meaning and drift is not expressible:
 *
 *   tokens/         DESIGN_SYSTEM  values only, no selectors that aren't :root

 *   pages/          PAGE           route targets. Nothing may import one.
 *
 * PAGE exists so that "a page is not a reusable component" is a machine check
 * rather than a convention. If a page turns out to be reusable, extract the
 * reusable part down into features/ and leave the page a thin wrapper.
